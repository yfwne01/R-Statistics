## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#packages
library(randomForest) #Random forest for classification and regression
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(gbm)
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
library(caret) #partition the training and testing data
library(rpart)# Regressive Partitioning and Regression trees
library(rpart.plot)# Decision Tree plot

#setting the overall seed for reproduceability
set.seed(12345)

#load the data and clean up
trainUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
training <- read.csv(url(trainUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
testing <- read.csv(url(testUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

```



```{r}
#Cleaning the data

trainData<- training[, colSums(is.na(training)) == 0]
validData <- testing[, colSums(is.na(testing)) == 0]
dim(trainData)
dim(validData)

trainData <- trainData[, -c(1:7)]
validData <- validData[, -c(1:7)]
dim(trainData)
dim(validData)

```

```{r}
#partition the data so that 75% of the training dataset into training and the remaining 25% to testing
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=trainData$classe, p=0.75, list=FALSE)
TrainingSet <- trainData[inTrain, ]
TestingSet <- trainData[-inTrain, ]

dim(TrainingSet)
dim(TestingSet)

```

```{r}
#use decision tree for prediction
modfit1 <-rpart(classe ~ ., data=TrainingSet, method="class")
prediction1 <- predict(modfit1, TestingSet, type = "class")

#plot the decision tree
rpart.plot(modfit1, main="Classification Tree", extra=102, under=TRUE, faclen=0)

confusionMatrix(TestingSet$classe, prediction1)


```

```{r}
#use random forest for predition

modfit2 <-randomForest(classe ~ ., data=TrainingSet, method="class")
prediction2 <- predict(modfit2, TestingSet, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(prediction2, TestingSet$classe)



#Conclusion
#For 75% training and 25% testing with the seed (12345)
#Random Forest algorithm performed better than Decision Trees.Accuracy for Random Forest model was 0.995 (95% CI: (0.993, 0.997)) compared to 0.75 (95% CI: (0.739, 0.763)) for Decision Tree model.
#The random Forest model is choosen. The accuracy of the model is 0.995. The expected out-of-sample error is estimated at 0.005, or 0.5%

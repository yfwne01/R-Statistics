## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Sometimes you might have so many points on a map that it doesn't make sense to plot every marker.
#In these situations leaflet allows you to plot clusters of markers using addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()). 
#When you zoom in to each cluster, the clusters will separate until you can see the individual markers
library(leaflet)
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(500, min = 39.25, max = 39.35),
                 lng = runif(500, min = -76.65, max = -76.55))
df %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())

## Adding Legends
#Adding a legend can be useful if you have markers on your map with different colors:
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(20, min = 39.25, max = 39.35),
                 lng = runif(20, min = -76.65, max = -76.55),
                 col = sample(c("red", "blue", "green"), 20, replace = TRUE),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(color = df$col) %>%
  addLegend(labels = LETTERS[1:3], colors = c("blue", "red", "green"))
```

Create a generalized model to predict the number of All-NBA selections for any given player at any point in their NBA career.
You may take advantage of any publicly available data for your modeling; however, your work must be original. Please use R or Python as the primary method to complete this project.
After the modeling phase, please answer the questions below, limiting responses to 1-2 paragraphs.
1. Describe, generally, from start to finish how you approached, executed, and completed the project. Include all relevant materials (ex: code) through a cloud storage provider (ex: Dropbox, Google Drive).
2. Include and describe a visualization from the project. The visualization should highlight a feature or insight from your model. Explain the decisions you made in constructing the visualization.
3. Using your model, estimate for the players listed below: (i) the total number of All-NBA selections remaining in each of these player’s careers, and (ii) the likelihood of each player having the greatest number of All-NBA selections remaining among this group.
• Luka Doncic
• Karl Anthony-Towns
• Kyrie Irving
• Stephen Curry

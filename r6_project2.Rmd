## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package
#1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
data("ToothGrowth")
str(ToothGrowth)
summary(ToothGrowth)
table(ToothGrowth$supp,ToothGrowth$dose)

#this dataframe contains 60 observations of 3 variables.Variables supp of type factors has two levels (VC ad OJ).
# from the table command, there are three dose levels: 0.5,1,and 2 mg/day
```

```{r}
#2.Provide a basic summary of the data.
g <- ggplot(data=ToothGrowth, aes(x=as.factor(dose), y=len, fill=supp)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") +
facet_grid(. ~ supp) +xlab("Dose(mg)") +ylab("Tooth length")
g


#3.Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. 

#test the null hypothesis that mean length of odontoblasts for ascorbic acid (VC) and orange juice (OJ) does not differ significantly
hypoth1 <- t.test(len ~ supp, data = ToothGrowth) 
 hypoth1$conf.int
 hypoth1$p.value
 #alpha=0.05
 
hypoth2<-t.test(len ~ supp, data = subset(ToothGrowth, dose == 0.5)) 
hypoth2$conf.int
hypoth2$p.value

hypoth3<-t.test(len ~ supp, data = subset(ToothGrowth, dose == 1)) 
hypoth3$conf.int
hypoth3$p.value

hypoth4<-t.test(len ~ supp, data = subset(ToothGrowth, dose == 2)) 
hypoth4$conf.int
hypoth4$p.value


# 4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
#OJ ensures more tooth growth than VC for dosages 0.5 & 1.0. (bc p-value is smaller than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that a significant difference does exis)
#OJ and VC gives the same amount of tooth growth for dose amount 2.0 mg/day. (bc p-value is larger than alpha, so we cannot conclude that a significant difference exists)
#For the entire trail we cannot conclude OJ is more effective that VC for all dos amounts
